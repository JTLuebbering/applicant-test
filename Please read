Hello! I am very happy to be selected for an opportunity to show what I can bring to the team. I have made many changes to the repository, as requested.
If you are going to download it and run it, everything is referenced to the applicant-test-master folder insted of just applicant-test.
I assume that if this change is not noticed, then a large portion of the website will not look correct. I hope you give this a look and
are happy with the look of it.

I look forward to hearing back from you,
Josh Luebbering
